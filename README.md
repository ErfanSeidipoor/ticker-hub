# README

## Introduction

This project is a learning platform designed to help students understand and apply microservices with Kubernetes and Skaffold. It is based on the monorepo framework NX and hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/ErfanSeidipoor/ticker-hub.

## Key Features

- Demonstrates how to build, deploy, and manage microservices using Kubernetes and Skaffold
- Provides hands-on experience with real-world use cases and examples
- Offers a comprehensive understanding of microservices, Kubernetes, and Skaffold
- Encourages students to experiment with different scenarios and explore new concepts
- Designed using the monorepo framework NX

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have a basic understanding of microservices and a working knowledge of Kubernetes, Skaffold, and NX. If you're new to these technologies, you may want to consider taking a course or reading some introductory material before diving into this project.

Once you're ready to start, follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Install Docker and Kubernetes on your local machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `skaffold run` to build and deploy the microservices.
4. Use the `kubectl` command line tool to manage and monitor your microservices.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project is based on microservices, with each service performing a specific function. The services are deployed using Kubernetes and managed using Skaffold. The project is designed using the monorepo framework NX.
